Problem statement: Radiation therapy is used to treat more than half of all people with cancer. Radiation is used in high doses to damage malignant cells, which leads to their death or slowdown in growth. Radiation therapy does not kill cancer cells 
the first time and the process take time. Radiation has a negative effect on the patient's healthy cells. Using a robot and fixing the exact location of the irradiation will help to make the irradiation with minimal damage to healthy tissues in the 
irradiated area.
